  name: 'Unravelling the shoot-root relationship in the context of flowering induction in Arabidopsis'
  description: >
    The induction of flowering is a complex process involving hundreds of genes that are part of different interconnected pathways. Together, they converge to regulate a small subset of genes that are responsible for the switch from the vegetative to the reproductive phase of the plant life cycle. Photoperiodic induction of flowering is mediated by a mobile signal produced in phloemâ€™s companion cells that subsequently migrates to the shoot apical meristem and likely reaches roots. My work intends to use an integrative approach to unravel the relationships that exist between roots and shoot during the induction of flowering but also to identify the role of flowering time genes expressed in roots.

  name: 'Building a database of flowering time genes in Arabidopsis'
  description: >
    The flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana is a very complex process that has been extensively studied. Hence, a lot of data about the molecular mechanisms regulating this process have been collected. Nevertheless, the absence of a is a major gap that we are currently adressing by creating a comprehensive and currated repository of those genes and the associated phenotypes.
