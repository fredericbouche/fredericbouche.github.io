intro:
  title: Welcome!
  body: >
    I'm a plant molecular biologist at the [University of Madison-Wisconsin](http://www.wisc.edu/).
    After a master degree in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Liège (Belgium), I completed a Ph.D. thesis on [the genetic mechanisms controlling the flowering time at the whole-plant scale, including roots](http://hdl.handle.net/2268/190592). In parallel to my bench work, I initiated the development of [FLOR-ID](http://www.phytosystems.ulg.ac.be/florid/), a curated and interactive database summarizing the accumulated knowledge about the onset of reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
    I now work as a Postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Prof. Amasino lab), where I study the genetic pathways regulating the onset of flowering in Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species closely related to wheat, barley, and oats.
