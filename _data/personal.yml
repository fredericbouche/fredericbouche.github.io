intro:
  title: Welcome!
  body: >
    I'm a plant molecular biologist at the [University of Liège (Belgium)](https://www.uliege.be){:target="_blank"}.
    After a master degree in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Liège (Belgium), I completed a Ph.D. thesis on [the genetic mechanisms controlling the flowering time of Arabidopsis at the whole-plant scale, including roots](http://hdl.handle.net/2268/190592){:target="_blank"}. In parallel to my bench work, I initiated the development of [FLOR-ID](http://www.phytosystems.ulg.ac.be/florid/){:target="_blank"}, a curated and interactive database summarizing the accumulated knowledge about the onset of reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
    I subsequently performed a fruitful postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison], in [Prof. Amasino's lab](https://biochem.wisc.edu/faculty/amasino){:target="_blank"}, where I studied the genetic pathways regulating the onset of flowering in Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species closely related to wheat, barley, and oats. After 2 years of postdoc, I returned to the University of Liège where I continue studying the genetic basis of flowering time in Pooideae.
