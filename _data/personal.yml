intro:
  title: Welcome!
  body: >
    I'm a plant molecular biologist at the [University of Madison-Wisconsin](http://bit.ly/1DkZq22).
    After completing my master degree in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Liège (Belgium), I started a Ph.D. thesis in the lab of Prof. Claire Périlleux, where I worked on the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. As an Aspirant F.R.S.-FNRS, I studied [the genetic mechanisms controlling the flowering time at the whole-plant scale, including roots](http://hdl.handle.net/2268/190592), and earned a Ph.D. degree in 2015. In parallel to my bench work, I initiated the development of [FLOR-ID](http://www.phytosystems.ulg.ac.be/florid/), a curated and interactive database summarizing the accumulated knowledge about the onset of reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
    As a Postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison ([BAEF Fellow](http://www.baef.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en)), I am currently working with Prof. Richard Amasino, one of the leading expert in the field of the genetic control of plant reproductive development. I study the genetic pathways regulating the onset of flowering in Brachypodium distachyon, a model grass species closely related to wheat, barley, and oats.
